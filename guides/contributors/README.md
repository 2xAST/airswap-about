# Contributors

## How can I contribute to AirSwap?

AirSwap contributors are organised into 3 main workstreams which we call "Circles". These circles are responsible for guiding, developing and growing the project.

### 1. Governance

The AirSwap Governance Circle is responsible for ideating, debating, and drafting AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIPs\). Each proposal helps to guide the direction of AirSwap by outlining a problem or opportunity and specifies a solution and its tradeoffs. Proposals cover all sorts of topics like new protocols, smart contracts, network tooling, applications, marketing, tokenomics, and more!

### 2. Development

Software is the lifeblood of AirSwap. Developers and designers take cue from the roadmap drawn up by [authors](authors.md), voted in by [members ](../members/)and bring it to reality. We design and build highly efficient protocols and easy to use products, where digital assets can flow freely in a completely decentralized and permissionless way. Our mission is to become the standard peer-to-peer trading protocol system: a fundamental primitive of the decentralized economy.

If you can help us along the way to achieve our mission, join in our development circle!

### 3. Ambassadors

AirSwap ambassadors not only help to showcase our protocols and products, they also represent the best of our community. Ambassadors forge links with other communities in the DeFi space, providing other projects with an easy and robust way to swap their digital assets with each other. Ambassadors also help to welcome newcomers into our community, create useful onboarding guides \(like those on here!\) and engage the community through social media platforms.

Help AirSwap to connect up the future DeFi ecosystem in our ambassador circle!
