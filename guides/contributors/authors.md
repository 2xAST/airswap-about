# Authors

## How do I join the Governance Circle?

Members of the AirSwap community who are interested in joining the Governance Circle can reach out to any @author in [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io). Current authors in the Governance Circle can nominate other members to join the Circle. Nominees must receive 2 vouches from other authors to be confirmed into the Circle. Members who have shown previous interactions with community members in debating and discussing AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIPs\) will be given more consideration. Of course, all members should bear in mind the [code of conduct](../../code-of-conduct.md) when debating and discussing ideas! 

## How do I create a proposal?

Any author is welcome to create an AirSwap Improvement Proposal \(AIP\). Each proposal outlines a problem or opportunity and specifies a solution and its tradeoffs. Proposals cover all sorts of topics like new protocols, smart contracts, network tooling, applications, marketing, tokenomics, and more!

The structure of a proposal is as follows \(See: [AIP 1](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues/1/31)\). Each proposal includes a summary, specification, rationale, and copyright.

* **Summary** — A short \(200 word\) summary describing the proposal.
* **Specification** — Technical specification for the proposal.
* **Rationale** — Motivations, justifications, arguments for and against.
* **Copyright** — All proposals are public domain via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

To draft an AIP, create a new issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues) repository. Drafting an AIP is often done with community support. Authors are welcome to discuss their proposals and solicit feedback from the communities on [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io/) and on GitHub.

## What are the stages of a proposal?

Each proposal follows three main stages.

### Step 1: Drafting and Discussion

After initial brainstorming, the author creates a new topic on the [GitHub](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues). You can get help from your fellow members in the [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io/) \#authors channel. Collaborating with other members leverages our collective knowledge and can lead to better proposals overall. If the discussion gets very long mixed in with other threads, you can create a new thread for your proposal.

Discussion is generally a combination of:

1. **Brainstorming** on Discord where comments happen in real-time and community members build on each others ideas rapidly. A great way to iterate on fresh ideas.
2. **In-depth** discussion here on GitHub where slower moving comments contribute to our longer term memory and feedback gets integrated directly into proposals.

### Step 2: Calling a Vote

Voting happens every 4 weeks, so make sure to give plenty of time to discuss with the other Authors in the Circle, and continue to iterate on the proposal to make it the best version possible. Once ready, the author requests to push the AIP to the upcoming vote. Authors will need to come to a consensus in the governance circle about which AIPs are ready to go for voting.

AIPs called to vote will require a point-by-point summary of the proposal which will be put up on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth/). Authors will work with the Admins to ensure that the summaries are easily understood by the general Voting community.

### Step 3: Collecting Rewards

At the end of each voting cycle, Authors allocate GIVE tokens to other Authors on [Coordinape ](https://coordinape.com/)to reward other authors based on their contributions in that cycle. At the end of the cycle, AST rewards are paid out based on their allocation of GIVE tokens.
