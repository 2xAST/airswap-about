# Developers

## Mandate

Select and prioritize proposals from the project backlog to be implemented at the highest possible quality within reasonable timeframes.

## Scope

## How-to

### Coordination

Developers take cue from the roadmap drawn up by [authors](authors.md), voted in by [voters](voters.md) and bring it to reality. 

### Rewards

At the end of each voting cycle, Developers allocate GIVE tokens on [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) to reward other developers based on their contributions in that cycle. At the end of the cycle, AST rewards are paid out based on their allocation of GIVE tokens.
