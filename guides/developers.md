# Developers

## Mission

Developers take cue from the roadmap drawn up by [authors](authors.md), voted in by [voters](voters.md) and bring it to reality. We design and build highly efficient protocols and easy to use products, where digital assets can flow freely in a completely decentralized and permissionless way. Our mission is to become the standard peer-to-peer trading protocol system: a fundamental primitive of the decentralized economy.
