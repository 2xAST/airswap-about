# Staking

## Staking on Activate

To participate in voting, your staked AST \(sAST\) balance will be used to determine the weight of your votes. AST is staked at a 1:1 rate and tokens are unstakeable **from 0% to 100% over the course of 20 weeks and locked for the first 4 weeks**.

Staking and unstaking is done through the Codefi Activate platform. Follow the user guides below to learn how to stake your tokens using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Several older stakes were left on legacy staking contracts. For those on the [original ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa4C5107184a88D4B324Dd10D98a11dd8037823Fe)staking contract, the maximum amount available to unstake is 10% every 7 days \(until &lt; 100 AST\). 

There is another [deprecated ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x704c5818b574358dfb5225563852639151a943ec)staking contract which follows the same unstaking protocol \(**unstakeable from 0% to 100% over the course of 20 weeks and locked for the first 4 weeks**\), however unstaking must be done by [manually interacting with the smart contract](manual-unstaking.md) rather than through Codefi Activate. 

If you aren't sure which staking contract you are on, drop us a question in the [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io)!
