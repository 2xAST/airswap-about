# Members

AirSwap is community owned and community run. Members of the community hold a stake in the project by staking the AirSwap token \(AST\). Staking the token grants access to voting on key decisions, which gives members the ability to direct the future roadmap of the project in an open and transparent way.

Members play an important role in our journey! By making decisions which will impact the future roadmap of the project, all members of the community hold a shared responsibility for the future success of AirSwap.

In return, community members are rewarded for voting with points based on their stake in the project. These points can be used to claim their share of the fees generated by the platform. This embodies one of the key principles of the project - **winning together**!
