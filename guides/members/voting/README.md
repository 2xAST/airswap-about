# Voting

Reading up and informing yourself on each proposal is an important part of the process. Proposals can be browsed, reviewed, and contributed to in the [Proposal Discussions \(AIPs\)](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues) category on GitHub. Voters can often find additional context on [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io/).

Voting cycles take place every 4 weeks, where a number of AIPs will be voted on concurrently. You must vote on all proposals in order to earn the maximum number of points. To browse and participate in votes, visit the [AirSwap governance portal](https://activate.codefi.network/staking/airswap/governance) on Codefi Activate when voting is live. Note that voting is performed off-chain and does not cost gas \(ETH\).

At the completion of each vote that you participate in, youâ€™ll notice the Activate portal has updated your points balance. Once points are updated, participants are able to claim rewards.
