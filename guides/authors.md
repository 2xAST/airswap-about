# Authors

## Mission

The Authors' mission in the Governance Circle is to help chart the course for the project and guide its roadmap. Authors do this by brainstorming, discussing and drafting new AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIPs\) for the community to vote on. 

## Scope

The role of the authors revolves around the creation of AIPs. Any author is welcome to create an AIP. Each proposal must outline a problem or opportunity and specifies a solution and its tradeoffs. Proposals cover all sorts of topics like new protocols, smart contracts, network tooling, applications, marketing, tokenomics, and more!

## Process

### Joining

Members of the AirSwap community who are interested in joining the Governance Circle can reach out to any @author in [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io). Current authors in the Governance Circle can nominate other members to join the Circle. Nominees must receive 2 vouches from other authors to be confirmed into the Circle. Members who have shown previous interactions with community members in debating and discussing AIPs will be given more consideration. Of course, all members should bear in mind the [code of conduct](../../code-of-conduct.md) when debating and discussing ideas! 

### Proposing
Each proposal follows three main stages.

#### Step 1: Drafting

The author first identifies a relevant issue, or potential improvement for AirSwap. After initial brainstorming, the author creates a new topic on the [GitHub](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues). 

The structure of a proposal is as follows \(See: [AIP 1](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues/1/31)\). Each proposal includes a summary, specification, rationale, and copyright.

* **Summary** — A short \(200 word\) summary describing the proposal.
* **Rationale** — Motivations, justifications, arguments for and against.
* **Specification** — Technical specification for the proposal.
* **Copyright** — All proposals are public domain via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

#### Step 2: Discussion

Drafting an AIP is often done with community support. Authors are welcome to discuss their proposals and solicit feedback from your fellow members in the [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io/) \#authors channel. 

Collaborating with other authors leverages our collective knowledge and can lead to better proposals overall. If the discussion gets very long mixed in with other threads, you can create a new thread for your proposal.

Discussion is generally a combination of:

1. **Brainstorming** on Discord where comments happen in real-time and community members build on each others ideas rapidly. A great way to iterate on fresh ideas.
2. **In-depth** discussion here on GitHub where slower moving comments contribute to our longer term memory and feedback gets integrated directly into proposals.

#### Step 3: Calling a Vote

Voting happens every 4 weeks, so make sure to give plenty of time to discuss with the other Authors in the Circle, and continue to iterate on the proposal to make it the best version possible. 

Once ready, the author requests to push the AIP to the upcoming vote. Authors will need to come to a consensus in the governance circle about which AIPs are ready to go for voting.

AIPs called to vote will require a point-by-point summary of the proposal which will be put up on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.airswap.eth/). Authors will work with the Admins to ensure that the summaries are easily understood by the general Voting community.

### Rewards

At the end of each voting cycle, Authors allocate GIVE tokens on [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) to reward other authors based on their contributions in that cycle. At the end of the cycle, AST rewards are paid out based on their allocation of GIVE tokens.
