# Authors

The following is a guide for contributing AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIP\).

## How do I create a proposal?

Anyone is welcome to create an AIP. Each proposal outlines a problem or opportunity and specifies a solution and its tradeoffs. Proposals cover all sorts of topics like new protocols, smart contracts, network tooling, applications, marketing, tokenomics, and more!

The structure of a proposal is as follows \(See: [AIP 1](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues/1/31)\). Each proposal includes a summary, specification, rationale, and copyright.

* **Summary** — A short \(200 word\) summary describing the proposal.
* **Specification** — Technical specification for the proposal.
* **Rationale** — Motivations, justifications, arguments for and against.
* **Copyright** — All proposals are public domain via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

To draft an AIP, create a new topic in the [Proposal Discussion \(AIPs\)](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues) category. Drafting an AIP is often done with community support. Authors are welcome to discuss their proposals and solicit feedback from the communities on [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io/) and here on GitHub.

## What are the stages of a proposal?

Each proposal follows three main stages.

### Step 1: Drafting and Discussion

After initial brainstorming, the author creates a new topic in the [Proposal Discussions \(AIPs\)](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-aips/issues) category.

Discussion is generally a combination of:

1. **Brainstorming** on Discord where comments happen in real-time and community members build on each others ideas rapidly. A great way to iterate on fresh ideas.
2. **In-depth** discussion here on GitHub where slower moving comments contribute to our longer term memory and feedback gets integrated directly into proposals.

### Step 2: Calling a Vote

Once ready, the author requests to call a vote. Authors will need to come to a consensus in the governance circle about which AIPs are ready to go for voting.

1. Authors must stake at least 1000 AST to call a vote. To stake AST, navigate to [Codefi Activate](https://activate.codefi.network/staking/airswap/governance) and follow the instructions on the AirSwap governance portal. To verify your staked balance, type “!join” in the Discord to confirm your stake, which gives you the **Author** role.
2. After discussions, authors will decide which proposals will be called to vote in the current voting cycle. This takes place in the \#authors channel in [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io).
3. Accepted proposals are placed on the project roadmap. If rejected, the author can solicit feedback from the community on how to improve the proposal.

### Step 3: Collecting Rewards

At the end of each voting cycle, authors allocate GIVE tokens to other authors on [Coordinape ](https://coordinape.com/)to reward other authors based on their contributions in that cycle. At the end of the cycle, AST rewards are paid out based on their allocation of GIVE tokens.

Reach out to community managers in [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io) if you would like to get added to the governance circle!

## Getting help with your proposal

You can get help from your fellow members in the [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io/) \#authors. Collaborating with other members leverages our collective knowledge and can lead to better proposals overall. If the discussion gets very long mixed in with other threads, you can create a new thread for your proposal.

Your humble community manager @CryptoHamilton \(Anthony Albertorio\) is also here to assist you. Just message him in \#authors or \#general, and he will help you with the process.
