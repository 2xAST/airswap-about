# Ambassadors

## Mandate

Develop our collective knowledge and expand our presence through high quality engagement and productive ecosystem relationships.

## Scope

The scope of the Ambassador program revolves around three main areas. Ambassadors are welcome to propose ideas which will grow AirSwap in any of these areas.

* **Awareness** - projects which help to bring awareness to AirSwap
    * Awareness of the product - driving user engagement with the web app
    * Awareness of the protocol - driving new integrations
    * Awareness of our community - welcoming new members and contributors
* **Internal engagement** - engaging the community and communicating updates
* **External engagement** - identifying and building relationships with relevant projects


## How-to

### Coordination

Ambassadors work together on [ongoing projects](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-growth/projects/1) through [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io) channels. The Ambassador circle meets weekly to discuss ongoing projects and tasks. Shorter meetings may also be arranged for special topics. 

### Equipping

Ambassadors can find useful information in the [guides](https://about.airswap.io). Ambassadors should also familiarize themselves with useful community built [resources](../../resources.md), which contain helpful statistics and tools for the community.

Cross-circle sharing sessions will also be organised to get Ambassadors familiarized with not only the product and protocols, but also the people involved in AirSwap.

### Engagement

Ambassadors are typically the first contact for newcomers to the community - so please be welcoming and helpful to our new friends! Remember to adhere to our code of conduct when engaging with community members.

* **No price talk.** Speculation is detrimental and counterproductive to our mission. Do not talk about price. Keep discussions about building, growing, and governing AirSwap.
* **Respect diversity.** This community is built by people across the globe from many walks of life with many perspectives. Honor that diversity; it gives us strength.
* **Win together.** As members of the AirSwap community, we each share common goals and all share the opportunity to contribute and help AirSwap succeed.

Ambassadors are also encouraged to participate in other communities, in order to understand and identify potential partners. As an Ambassador, you help to represent the AirSwap community, and as such should always behave appropriately - especially in other communities.

Ambassadors would also need to keep up-to-date with the latest discussions and proposals in AirSwap, so that general queries can be addressed or, at least, pointed in the right direction. 

For more information, please refer to our [code of conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).

### Rewards

At the end of each voting cycle, ambassadors allocate GIVE tokens on [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) to reward other ambassadors based on their contributions during that cycle. At the end of the cycle, rewards are paid out based on their allocation of GIVE tokens.

### Joining

Members who are interested in joining the Ambassadors circle can reach out to other @ambassadors in [Discord](https://chat.airswap.io). In general, Ambassadors are selected based on language spoken, their knowledge of AirSwap, their connections with other communities, their motivations, skills and visions.

Ambassadors-in-training would be expected to read the [guides](https://about.airswap.io) to understand more about AirSwap's product and technology, and to help welcome new members into the community. Once ready, Ambassadors can nominate any ambassador-in-training into the Ambassador circle. If two other Ambassadors vouch for the nominee, s/he will automatically be inducted into the circle and can benefit from the circle rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ambassadors-in-training can help to create content (e.g. tutorials and guides) and be rewarded in [bounties](../bounties.md)!
