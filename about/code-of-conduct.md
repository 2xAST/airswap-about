# AirSwap Code of Conduct

**We are an open community that builds decentralized trading software.**

Our greatest chance at success comes from creating a respectful environment where people want to come, stay, and participate for the long term.

## Guidance

The following code of conduct extends the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

- **Collaborate rather than compete.** Add energy by working together, building on each other's ideas, and give without expectations. Pay it forward. Put ideas into action.
- **Discuss rather than campaign.** The best ideas are developed through iteration by openly discussing, integrating, and updating as you learn.
- **Be an ally; not an adversary.** Be patient and allow others time to listen and speak. Interact as if you’re face to face. Support other ideas as best you can.

---

We all work together toward community goals. AirSwap is a positive-sum project with long-term vision. Short-term, extractive behavior is not tolerated.

## Rules

- **No price talk.** Speculation is detrimental and counterproductive to our mission. Do not talk about price. Keep discussions about building, growing, and governing AirSwap.
- **Respect diversity.** This community is built by people across the globe from many walks of life with many perspectives. Honor that diversity; it gives us strength.
- **Win together.** As members of the AirSwap community, we each share common goals and all share the opportunity to contribute and help AirSwap succeed.

## Roles

- **Members** are staked AirSwap Tokens (sAST) holders who participate in votes.
- **Authors** support the proposal (AIP) creation and publishing process.
- **Developers** contribute code to software projects being built by the community.
- **Designers** contribute visual, UI, and UX design and coordinate with developers.
- **Marketers** help deliver community software into the hands of intended audiences.

## Processes

Every 4 weeks…

- **Votes are run** for four days on one or more proposals.
- **Rewards are distributed** by contributors for work completed.
- **Bounties are assessed** and distributed by a project lead.
