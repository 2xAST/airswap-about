AirSwap is a peer-to-peer trading network for Ethereum tokens.

Every peer on the network, whether a [server running](instant/running-makers.md) on the public internet, a user connected through a [web application](instant/add-to-your-app.md), or a [smart contract](instant/deploying-delegates.md) running on a blockchain, is equipped to trade. Some peers are designed to always provide prices for taking. Some peers are designed to always request prices and take them. Some, both. Generally, peers can take either side of a trade, depending on their intentions.

Many forms of trading can be done peer-to-peer, including RFQ, last look, limit orders (issuing fixed price quotes), and partial fills (requesting specific amounts), in a fully trustless way. Additionally, two powerful features include authorizations and affiliates.
