Trading on AirSwap means no trading fees, no deposits, and no sign-ups: just plug in your digital wallet and go. An alternative to the often expensive and dangerous world of trading on centralized exchanges, AirSwap is a decentralized trading network that’s simple, easy, and safe.

AirSwap was built on the Swap Protocol, published in May 2017. Swap defined a profound shift in the way assets are traded by presenting a design for an open network to connect to peers based on common interest, to agree on a price through mutual cryptographic signatures, and to settle without intermediaries on the Ethereum blockchain.
The Swap Protocol has a role in decentralized finance as the “automated escrow” that you can use to trade any two tokenized assets on Ethereum. Entire trading networks have been built from this simple building block, and our team has played our part in delivering safe and friendly frontends for everyday traders like you.

# Naturally secure, peer-to-peer trading

You’ve likely heard the buzz around decentralized trading (DEX) before, especially in the aftershock of the hacks and closures of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather than dwelling on the dangers of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, let’s instead focus on the benefits of decentralized trading.

Peer-to-peer trading is secure by nature. Transactions are explicitly acknowledged and permitted by you through the use of a personal digital wallet. Security analysts have recognized this, naming AirSwap the #1 most secure DEX in a recent security report.
AirSwap does not match orders or host an order book. Because orders are peer-to-peer, there are no order collisions, race conditions, price slippage, or front-running prevalent in other decentralized trading designs.

# No sign-ups, deposits or trading fees

With AirSwap, you’ll never submit personal information or put your identity at risk on third-party servers. We believe in the mantra, “not your keys, not your coins”, meaning no deposits to a third-party wallet as you always retain control of your tokens until traded.

With AirSwap, there are no fees. Whether you are buying or selling, you will never pay trading fees to AirSwap. The only fee is the Ethereum Gas paid for the decentralized computation when settling a trade on Ethereum.

# Using the AirSwap token

At the protocol level on the AirSwap network, every trade is between a “maker,” who sets the price, and a “taker,” who has the option to accept it. Makers must be discoverable by takers for these connections to be made.
As a user on AirSwap Instant, this process is automatic. However, to provide liquidity to AirSwap Instant, makers must “stake” AirSwap tokens to signal their intent to trade. To learn more about being a maker on AirSwap, check out AirSwap for Developers.

# The future of trade is decentralized

AirSwap aims to be the “swap” at the heart of every peer-to-peer trade. As the world fills with tokens, products built on the Swap Protocol will power trading of all kinds of assets, and we see this as the very beginning.

Decentralization guides us toward many bright futures, and AirSwap is driving for one of secure, scalable, and private value exchange. By embracing a peer-to-peer design, we can reconstruct marketplaces without middlemen at a global scale.

AirSwap is intuitive, secure, and liquid. We built this network without taking your personal information, requiring you to deposit your tokens, or taking any trading fees. At a technical level, AirSwap is without front-running, price slippage, or order collisions.

_We believe this is the promise of decentralized trade._
