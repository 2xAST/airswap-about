## Why Stake on AirSwap?

The AST token can be staked which enables you to participate in governance of the protocol. If you are invested in the token, you should help participate by proposing, discussing and voting on the various AIPs to help move the platform forward.

In doing so, you will be rewarded with points based on the size of your AST stake. The points can be used to claim a portion of the funds from the rewards pool. The current fee reward structure is the subject of an upcoming AIP.

## How is AirSwap different than Uniswap?

Uniswap is a "peer-to-contract" automated market maker \(AMM\) that runs fully on-chain whereas AirSwap is a peer-to-peer network running as a combination of off-chain negotiation and on-chain settlement by atomic swap.

There are benefits to each. With AirSwap there is no price slippage and trades are unlimited size. The trade-off is that it's easier for everyday users to provide liquidity to Uniswap. However, a successful outcome for RFQ is a few high quality liquidity providers covering a variety of digital assets, so AirSwap does not require the same number of liquidity providers to be successful.
