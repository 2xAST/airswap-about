## Why use AirSwap?

AirSwap is similar to other decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap but with several key differences.

Uniswap is an automated market maker \(AMM\) that runs fully on-chain whereas AirSwap is a request-for-quote network \(RFQ\) that runs as a combination of off-chain \(peer-to-peer negotiation\) and on-chain \(settlement by atomic swap\).

There are benefits to each. With AirSwap there is no price slippage and trades are unlimited size. The trade-off is that it's easier for everyday users to provide liquidity to Uniswap. However, a successful outcome for RFQ is a few high quality liquidity providers covering a variety of digital assets, so AirSwap does not require the same level of democratization as Uniswap for the network to be liquid.

AirSwap has been implemented in Metamask Swap which is currently responsible for around 97% of the volume on AirSwap. Every time AirSwap is used to trade in metamask, a 0.3% fee is taken and sent to a rewards contract.

## Why Stake on AirSwap?

The AST token can be staked which enables you to participate in governance of the protocol. If you are invested in the token, you should help participate by proposing, discussing and voting on the various AIPs to help move the platform forward.

In doing so, you will be rewarded with points based on the size of your AST stake. The points can be used to claim a portion of the funds from the rewards pool. The current fee reward structure is the subject of an upcoming AIP.

## What are the benefits of AirSwap?

AirSwap has a number of benefits.

* No sign-ups. We do not require users to sign up and do not collect sensitive data.
* No fees. There are no fees baked into any trades on the AirSwap network.
* No slippage. AirSwap is p2p, users decide the exact prices they wish to trade, and execution prices are not subject to “slippage”, or getting a different price than you expect. On AirSwap, the price you see is the price you get.
* Intuitive. AirSwap is designed with UX as one of our top priorities.
* Secure. AirSwap was rated the \#1 safest Ethereum decentralized exchange.
