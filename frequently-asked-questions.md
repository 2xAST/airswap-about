AirSwap Tokens \(AST\) can be staked to participate in governance of the protocol. All are welcome to participate by proposing, discussing, and voting on proposals that move the project and community forward.

Voters are rewarded with points based on the amount staked. Points can be used to claim a portion of the funds from the rewards pool. Check out [this tutorial](guides/members/) to learn more.

## How is AirSwap different than Uniswap?

Uniswap is a "peer-to-contract" automated market maker \(AMM\) that runs fully on-chain. AirSwap is a peer-to-peer network combining off-chain negotiation and on-chain settlement by atomic swap.

There are benefits to each. With AirSwap there is no price slippage and trades are unlimited size. The trade-off is that it's easier for everyday users to provide liquidity to Uniswap. However, a successful outcome for RFQ is a few high quality liquidity providers covering a variety of digital assets, so AirSwap does not require the same number of liquidity providers to be successful.
