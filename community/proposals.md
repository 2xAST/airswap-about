description: Learn how AirSwap continuously upgrades itself through the community
---

AirSwap is organized as a decentralized network of contributors using a steering process called [AirSwap Improvement Proposals (AIP)](https://github.com/airswap/AIPs/issues/1). Some projects are best presented as AirSwap Improvement Proposals (AIPs) to garner community support. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it’ll be built—that’s up to contributors and based on expected project impact.

Good project proposals…

- **Make a "business case"** for dedicating resources to a project. This could mean identifying a new customer segment or estimating a positive impact on trading volume.
- **Specify a rough project scope** of X taking a rough time of Y to complete without going deep into product details—actual specs can be drafted in parallel or after a vote.
- **Present a clear benefit** to AirSwap. After all, what we work on benefits us and our community. We ultimately build together with and for our fellow contributors.

Some projects are proposed as AIPs…

- Proposals that **request AST from the treasury** must be proposed as an AIP for community vote and if passed will execute on the project multi-signature wallet.
- Proposals that **specify or update parameters** or other configurations that impact the functioning of the DAO or compensation structures.
- Proposals that **would benefit from community support** as a way to signal importance and impact to potential contributors or the community at large.

Each proposal is authored by one or more authors. The AIP is ratified as a community proposal once it is called to vote and accepted by token holders. Once accepted, the AIP is placed in a backlog for selection by developers. Developers select proposals for prioritization and implementation based on their requirements and feasibility. Once complete, ambassadors help to deliver projects and bring awareness to a wider audience.

Several incentives to participate are built in. Every month…

- **Votes are run** for four days on one or more proposals.
- **Rewards are distributed** to contributors for work completed.
