description: Learn how AirSwap continuously upgrades itself through the community

# Process

AirSwap is organized as a decentralized network of contributors using a continuous process called [AirSwap Improvement Proposals (AIP)](https://github.com/airswap/AIPs/issues/1). This process is how the community captures, selects, and prioritizes new projects.

Each proposal is authored by one or more authors. The AIP is ratified as a community proposal once it is called to vote and accepted by token holders. Once accepted, the AIP is placed in a backlog for selection by developers. Developers select proposals for prioritization and implementation based on their requirements and feasibility. Once complete, ambassadors help to deliver projects and bring awareness to a wider audience.

Several incentives to participate are built in. Every monthâ€¦

* **Votes are run** for four days on one or more proposals.
* **Rewards are distributed** to contributors for work completed.
* **Bounties are assessed** and distributed by a project lead.
