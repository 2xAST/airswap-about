# Community

AirSwap itself is a community asset owned by its token \(AST\) holders, operating as an open project with a transparent decision-making and product development process. Both the network technology and organization aim to be maximally decentralized. Community members stake AirSwap tokens \(AST\) to participate in governance and other community activities and benefits. Ideating, drafting, voting on, and accepting proposals is an open process.

AirSwap is **accessible**, **equitable**, and **transparent**. Every participant and contributor is treated fairly and rewarded consistently. All opportunities are inclusive and available. Decisions are made in the open and contributions are open source. New information is continuously and actively shared throughout.

There are lots of ways to get involved in AirSwap, from generating ideas, to coordinating projects, contributing design and code, and helping to spread the word.

## Process

AirSwap is organized as a decentralized network of contributors using a continuous process called [AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIP\)](https://github.com/airswap/AIPs/issues/1). This process is how the community captures, selects, and prioritizes new projects.

Each proposal is authored by one or more contributors. The AIP is ratified as a community proposal once it is called to vote and accepted by token holders. Once accepted, the AIP is placed in a backlog for selection by contributors. Contributors select proposals for prioritization and implementation based on their requirements and feasibility, 

Several incentives to participate are built in. Every 4 weeksâ€¦

* **Votes are run** for four days on one or more proposals.
* **Rewards are distributed** to contributors for work completed.
* **Bounties are assessed** and distributed by a project lead.
