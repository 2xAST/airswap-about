# Conduct

Our greatest chance at success comes from creating a respectful environment where people want to come, stay, and participate over the long term.

## Guidance

The following code of conduct extends the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

- **Collaborate rather than compete.** Add energy by working together, building on each other's ideas, and give without expectations. Pay it forward. Put ideas into action.
- **Discuss rather than campaign.** The best ideas are developed through iteration by openly discussing, integrating, and updating as you learn.
- **Be an ally; not an adversary.** Be patient and allow others time to listen and speak. Interact as if youâ€™re face to face. Support other ideas as best you can.

We all work together toward community goals. AirSwap is a positive-sum project with long-term vision. Short-term, extractive behavior is not tolerated.

## Rules

- **No price talk.** Speculation is detrimental and counterproductive to our mission. Do not talk about price. Keep discussions about building, growing, and governing AirSwap.
- **Respect diversity.** This community is built by people across the globe from many walks of life with many perspectives. Honor that diversity; it gives us strength.
- **Win together.** As members of the AirSwap community, we each share common goals and all share the opportunity to contribute and help AirSwap succeed.

## Thanks

Everyone in the community is excited to have you involved. Let's do this!
