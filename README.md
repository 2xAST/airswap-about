[AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) is a peer-to-peer trading network for Ethereum tokens. AirSwap was built on the Swap Protocol, published in May 2017. Swap defined a profound shift in the way assets are traded by presenting a design for an open network to connect to peers based on common interest, to agree on a price through mutual cryptographic signatures, and to settle without intermediaries on the Ethereum blockchain.

Trading on AirSwap means no trading fees, no deposits, and no sign-ups: just plug in your digital wallet and go. An alternative to the often expensive and dangerous world of trading on centralized exchanges, AirSwap is a decentralized trading network that’s simple, easy, and safe.

The Swap Protocol has a role in decentralized finance as the “automated escrow” that you can use to trade any two tokenized assets on Ethereum. Entire trading networks have been built from this simple building block, and our team has played our part in delivering safe and friendly frontends for everyday traders like you.

Peer-to-peer trading is secure by nature. Transactions are explicitly acknowledged and permitted by you through the use of a personal digital wallet. Security analysts have recognized this, naming AirSwap the #1 most secure DEX in a recent security report.
AirSwap does not match orders or host an order book. Because orders are peer-to-peer, there are no order collisions, race conditions, price slippage, or front-running prevalent in other decentralized trading designs.

With AirSwap, you’ll never submit personal information or put your identity at risk on third-party servers. We believe in the mantra, “not your keys, not your coins”, meaning no deposits to a third-party wallet as you always retain control of your tokens until traded.

With AirSwap, there are no fees. Whether you are buying or selling, you will never pay trading fees to AirSwap. The only fee is the Ethereum Gas paid for the decentralized computation when settling a trade on Ethereum.
