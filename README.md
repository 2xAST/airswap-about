[AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) is a peer-to-peer trading network for Ethereum tokens. AirSwap was built on the Swap Protocol, a profound shift in the way assets are traded by presenting a design for an open network to connect to peers based on common interest, to agree on a price through mutual cryptographic signatures, and to settle without intermediaries on the Ethereum blockchain.
