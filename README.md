[AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) is a peer-to-peer trading network for Ethereum tokens. Peers connect based on common interest, agree on a price through mutual cryptographic signatures, and settle trades without intermediaries. At the heart of the AirSwap network is [Swap](./reference/swap.md), which enables trustless peer-to-peer trading. Swap is a simple contract that supports a variety of tokens and signature types.

# Quick Start

- **Run** a **Server** on AirSwap → [Build a Maker](./make-liquidity/run-a-server.md)
- **Embed** AirSwap into **Your App** → [Embed AirSwap](./take-liquidity/embed-airswap.md)
- **Learn** about **Smart Contracts** → [Swap](./reference/swap.md) · [Indexer](./reference/indexer.md) · [Delegate](./reference/delegate.md)

# Peer-to-Peer

Every participant on the network, whether a [server running](./make-liquidity/run-a-server.md) on the public internet, a user connected through a [web application](./take-liquidity/embed-airswap.md), a trader connected through a [terminal](./tools/airswap-cli), or a configured [smart contract](./reference/delegate.md), is equipped to trade. Peers can take either side of a trade, depending on their intentions. Many forms of trading can be done peer-to-peer, including RFQ, last look, limit orders (issuing fixed price quotes), and partial fills (requesting specific amounts), in a fully trustless way.

**For end users**, no trading fees, no deposits, and no sign-ups. AirSwap is simple enough to stay intuitive, secure, and liquid, without front-running, price slippage, or order collisions.

**For makers**, no costly price updates with onchain order books. Prices are per request. Easily manage exposure, and if needed, cancel specific orders or in batch in a single transaction.
