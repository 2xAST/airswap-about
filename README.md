AirSwap is an open developer community building decentralized trading systems. AirSwap techonlogy powers automated peer-to-peer swap networks with standardised [RFQ](technology/request-for-quote.md) and [Last Look](technology/last-look.md) protocols in use by the top traders and exchange systems in DeFi today.

Our vision is a future where all forms of value are represented as digital assets and flow freely and reliably among people and communities around the world. Our mission is to be the world’s best peer-to-peer trading system: a fundamental primitive of the decentralized economy.

## Technology

AirSwap enables an open network of market participants to discover each other and trade directly peer-to-peer using a combination of web protocols and smart contracts. Trading directly with a counterparty rather than via AMM or order book means getting exact prices, MEV-resistance, and gas efficient swaps. AirSwap technology is [open source](https://github.com/airswap/) and developers earn rewards for their contributions from fees generated by the protocol.

### Protocols

An atomic swap is a a transaction between counterparties that either completely succeeds \(both sides successfully transfer\) or the entire tranasction reverts. Atomic swaps enable multiple forms of decentralized trading as a combination of off-chain \(peer-to-peer negotiation\) and on-chain \(settlement by atomic swap\).

* [Request-for-quote](technology/request-for-quote.md) \(RFQ\) is an automated request-response style protocol for market makers running web servers from which clients request orders via JSON-RPC over HTTP.
* [Last Look](technology/last-look.md) \(LL\) is an automated streaming protocol that allows market makers to stream pricing to clients via JSON-RPC over WebSocket, which in turn submit orders to the server for settlement.
* [Over-the-counter](https://trader.airswap.io/) \(OTC\) is trading between known counterparties via chat applications or email using AirSwap for settlement. Some of the [largest trades](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x346a9f45c70d4f323c67fd0f348b2a8aaa7477a719557c27a8130c8873279d3b) in DeFi have been made on AirSwap OTC.

### Applications

Several applications are available to end-users.

* [AirSwap Web](https://preview.airswap.io/) — **\(alpha\)** New open source web app currently in development.
* [AirSwap OTC](https://trader.airswap.io/) — Industry standard OTC interface for large bespoke swaps.
* [AirSwap CLI](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-cli) — Command-line interface for interacting with AirSwap.

### Integrations

Several market makers and DEX aggregators have implemented AirSwap.

* [MetaMask Swaps](https://metamask.io/swaps.html) — Swap directly from the MetaMask wallet browser extension.

## Community

AirSwap community members have staked AirSwap tokens \(AST\) to participate in governance and other community activities and benefits. Ideating, drafting, voting on, and accepting proposals is an open process.

AirSwap is **accessible**, **equitable**, and **transparent**. The more open and connected the community is the healthier the network will be. Every participant and contributor is treated fairly and rewarded consistently. All opportunities are inclusive and available. Decisions are made in the open and contributions are open source. New information is continuously and actively shared throughout.

### Principles

We believe that decentralized governance starts with shared principles to align collective decision-making and best achieve our mission of being the world's best peer-to-peer trading system.

1. **Design for simplicity** — Perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away. This is particularly true with blockchain based technology and applications.
2. **Prioritize security** — Our work is done in an adversarial setting. While blockchain requires users to take security into their own hands, they trust AirSwap to be designed and to operate in a secure way.
3. **Decide with data** — Drive decisions with data that matters. AirSwap performance indicators are trading volume, token holders, community engagement, and tokens used for governance.
4. **Seek opportunity** — Decentralized finance is abundant with opportunities. Seek and prioritize opportunities that positively impact both AirSwap and the broader ecosystem.
5. **Win together** — Our community spans platforms across cyberspace and countries across the globe. We grow by both sharing responsibility and celebrating each success.

### Governance

To generate the best ideas for the project and cultivate an open decision making process, the AirSwap community uses AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIP\). AIPs give the community a process to develop and finalize proposals to core contributors on an ongoing basis. For more information see [AIP 1](https://community.airswap.io/t/aip-1-proposal-how-to) and check out [all active proposals](https://github.com/airswap/aips).

Voting is held on [Codefi Activate](https://activate.codefi.network/staking/airswap/governance). To participate in governance, see the [Voters](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-docs/tree/2515c986727706105a3e5ebabb8cfa6df455cbb0/guides/voters.md) guide. Once votes are completed, proposals are considered finalized and assessed by contributors. Based on requirements and feasibility, contributors may accept the proposal for prioritization and implementation.
