# Examples

## Onchain Peer with Rules

The [authorization feature](/protocols/swap/README.md#authorizations) enables traders to deploy smart contracts that trade on their behalf. These contracts can include arbitrary logic and connect to other liquidity sources.

## Onchain Liquidity Consumer

An arrangement of smart contracts and authorizations can enable wallets to take liquidity without additional signatures. An onchain liquidity "consumer" can interact with an onchain indexer and onchain peers in a single transaction.
