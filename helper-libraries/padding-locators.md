When Ethereum addresses are used as the locator for an entry on the Indexer, the locator must be stored as a bytes32 not an address to be consistent with the other types of locators. `padding.js` provides a function to pad addresses into a bytes32 format.

You can find the `padding.js` library on NPM within [@airswap/test-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@airswap/test-utils) or on the [AirSwap GitHub](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-protocols/blob/master/utils/test-utils/src/padding.js)
