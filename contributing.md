# Contributing

There are many ways to get involved from generating ideas, to coordinating projects, contributing design and code, and helping to spread the word.

## Roles

* [**Voters**](guides/voters.md) are staked AirSwap Tokens \(sAST\) holders who participate in AIP votes.
* \*\*\*\*[**Authors**](guides/authors.md) support the proposal \(AIP\) creation and publishing process.
* **Developers** contribute code to software projects being built by the community.
* **Designers** contribute visual, UI, and UX design and coordinate with developers.
* **Marketers** help deliver community software into the hands of our audiences.

See a list of [active projects](https://github.com/airswap/AIPs/issues), proposals [ready to be built](https://github.com/airswap/AIPs/issues), and open [bounty categories](guides/bounties.md).

## Process

AirSwap is organized as a decentralized network of contributors using a continuous process called [AirSwap Improvement Proposals \(AIP\)](https://github.com/airswap/AIPs/issues/1). This process is how the community captures, selects, and prioritizes new projects.

Each proposal is authored by one or more contributors. To “ratify” an AIP as a community proposal, it’s called to vote by the author and voted on by token holders. Once accepted, the AIP is placed in a backlog for selection by developers.

Several incentives to participate are built in. Every 4 weeks…

* **Votes are run** for four days on one or more proposals.
* **Rewards are distributed** by contributors for work completed.
* **Bounties are assessed** and distributed by a project lead.
